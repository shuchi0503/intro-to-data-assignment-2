    <h1>Are Newsracks Really Ruining NYC&#39s Sidewalks?</h1>
    <h2>A Post-Bill Look at the City&#39s Newsrack Inspections</h2>

            The New York City Council, on November 13, passed a bill (Intro.663) granting the Department of Transportation more authority to tighten regulations for the city&#39s newsracks. The bill addresses their size, shape, materials and where they may be placed on the sidewalks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here&#39s what the newsrack inspections showed us before the bill was passed:

            Of the total 6,203 newsracks inspected in the last decade, around 31% were found to be in compliance with the DOT&#39s regulations. Newsracks with violations took up a much smaller number, and violating conditions were resolved for almost 17% of the newsracks inspected.  However, a significant number of newsracks, around 26%, were not found at their registered locations, and approximately 12% were removed. The DOT may remove newsracks if they are abandoned, if the owners refuse to correct violations or are repeat violators, if the sidewalk space is needed for public transportation/utility work or in case of emergencies.

            The DOT also keeps track of pending complaints, pending reinspections, incomplete inspections and failures to reinspect. These took up considerably less space in the inspection numbers.

            How did the DOT enforce its rules anyway?
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, when a violation is identified, the DOT issues a Notice of Correction (NOC), followed by a Notice of Violation (NOV) if unresolved. These are answerable at the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH). This new bill requires the DOT to notify newsrack owners of the changed obligations imposed.
